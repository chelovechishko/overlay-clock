overlay-clock
=============

A small Chrome extension that displays - surprise! - an overlay clock

Displays a small digital clock at the corner of the screen. Colors are configurable. Can be restricted to full-screen pages only,
so can be used for example with the Web version of Kindle.

Based on the original [Overlay Clock extension] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/overlay-clock/jeeaienpeegfdhhaonccddlbkenfjdbo).
